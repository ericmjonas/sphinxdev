.SH NAME
sphinx-build \- Sphinx documentation generator tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sphinx-build
[\fIoptions\fR] <\fIsourcedir\fR> <\fIoutdir\fR> [\fIfilenames\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
sphinx-build generates documentation from the files in <sourcedir> and places it
in the <outdir>.

sphinx-build looks for <sourcedir>/conf.py for the configuration settings.
.B sphinx-quickstart(1)
may be used to generate template files, including conf.py.

sphinx-build can create documentation in different formats.  A format is
selected by specifying the builder name on the command line; it defaults to
HTML.  Builders can also perform other tasks related to documentation
processing.

By default, everything that is outdated is built.  Output only for selected
files can be built by specifying individual filenames.
